        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the fundamental building blocks of most websites. <br>
        HTML provides the structure and content, like headings, paragraphs, and images. <br>
        CSS adds the style, controlling the layout, fonts, and colors. <br>
        JavaScript brings everything to life, making web pages interactive by adding animations, responding to user clicks, and creating dynamic content. <br>
        Together, these three languages work in harmony to create the rich and engaging web experiences we use every day. <br>
