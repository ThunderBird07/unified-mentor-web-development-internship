            <p>CSS layout
                At this point, we've looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to correctly arrange your boxes in relation to the viewport as well as to one another. We've covered the necessary prerequisites, so let's dive deep into CSS layout, looking at such various features as: different display settings, positioning, modern layout tools like flexbox and CSS grid, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
                
                Prerequisites
                Before starting this module, you should already:
                
                Have basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module.
                Be comfortable with CSS fundamentals, as discussed in Introduction to CSS.
                Understand how to style boxes.
                Note: If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as JSBin or Glitch.
                
                Guides
                These articles will provide instruction on the fundamental layout tools and techniques available in CSS. At the end of the lessons is an assessment to help you check your understanding of layout methods by laying out a webpage.
                
                Introduction to CSS layout
                This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've already touched upon in previous modules — such as different display values — and introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering throughout this module.
                
                Normal flow
                Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.
                
                Flexbox
                Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals. After studying this guide you can test your flexbox skills to check your understanding before moving on.
                
                Grids
                CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will give you all you need to know to get started with page layout, then test your grid skills before moving on.
                
                Floats
                Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float property became one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. With the advent of Flexbox and Grid it has now returned to its original purpose, as this article explains.
                
                Positioning
                Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow and make them behave differently, for example, by sitting on top of one another, or by always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport.

            <h2>Sidebar Placement</h2>
            <p>The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example, "viewport is wider than 480 pixels". Media queries are a key part of responsive web design because they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport. They can also be used to detect other features of the environment your site is running on, for example, whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse. In this lesson, you will first learn about the syntax used in media queries, and then you will use them in an interactive example showing how a simple design might be made responsive.</p>
